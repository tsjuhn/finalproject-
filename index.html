				<p>When you think about college sports today, people are going to point to college football first. But not a lot of people pay attention as much to the Football Championship Subdivison(FCS) in comparison to the Football Bowl Subdivision(FBS). The main difference between the two is FCS schools tend to be working at way smaller budgets than FBS programs and the FCS has a unqiue playoff system. </p>
				<p>As of 2024, there are 129 teams competing in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), distributed across 13 conferences. Some of the more renowed conferences in the country include the Missouri Valley, the Big Sky and the CAA. Teams like North Dakota State, South Dakota State, Montana and Youngstown State are teams that have won multiple championships that are still in the FCS today. North Dakota State alone has won 9 national titles in the lasy 13 years. 
				<p>And it's no surprise that these schools spend most of their revenue into their football programs. </p>

<iframe title="FCS football total spending by school from 2021-2023" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-3hBzL" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3hBzL/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="613" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>


				<p>Upon sorting the data by football revenue, 20 schools were identified as generating over $15 million in total revenue from 2021-2023. Notably, James Madison led all programs in football investment, reporting expenditures exceeding $30 million, underscoring its substantial commitment to the sport during this period.</p>
				<p>But since JMU, Kennesaw State and Jacksonville State have all debuted at the FBS level in the last few years, those schools weren’t factored into this visual with the top 17 schools earning over 15 million in revenue. This list is topped out by Montana State. The Bobcats were ranked 9th in the final FCS poll in 2023. <p/
				<p>It’s not really that much of a surprise that those that put a lot of money into a football program are going to reap the benefits of success. There's always going to be a power imbalance in terms of player talent and facilities with schools that invest and schools that don't. 9 of the 17 schools were ranked inside the FCS top 25 poll at some point in 2023.</p>
				<p> Then, I ran a different data visualization for a separate advanced metric to determine how truly good a team is, in relation to revenue. <a href= "https://theanalyst.com/na/2024/08/introducing-fcs-football-tracr-metric">TRACR is a metric that considers how good a team is relative to the strength of its opponent.</a> TRACR accumulates with an offensive and defensive rating, and the difference between the two numbers gives the team an overall rating. It's developed by sports data website Opta analyst.</p>

				<iframe title="FCS football teams rated by the TRACR metric in 2024" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-9iPTF" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9iPTF/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="618" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>




				<p>Here its the top 20 teams in terms of the TRACR metric in the year 2024. 13 of the top 20 teams made it to this year's 2024 edition of the FCS playoffs. </p>
				<p>What about the 7 teams that didn't make it? 
					The 5th highest rated team, the Delaware Blue Hens finished this year 9-2. Starting next year, Delaware will make the move up from the FCS to the FBS level and join Conference USA. Delaware couldn't partipate in the playoffs this year therefore due to NCAA transition rules. NC Central is apart of the Mid-Eastern Atheltic conference(MEAC), who sends their champion to the Celebration Bowl against the winner of the Southwestern Atheltic Conference and not the playoffs.Ivy league teams like Yale and Harvard don't participate in the playoffs <a href= "https://www.underdogdynasty.com/2022/3/27/22997460/fcs-football-ivy-league-playoffs-harvard-crimson-yale-bulldogs-penn-dartmouth-princeton-brown">because of the league's priorities with academics over everthing</a></p>
				<p>But you would think with most of these successful teams accumulating so much in revenue that equated to success also have large NIL collectives. Suprisingly though, <a href="https://fearthefcs.com/2024/04/18/ncaa-adopts-new-transfer-and-nil-policies/>">just 43 out of the 129 FCS programs had NIL collectives as of late 2023.</a> And all of those are not surely guaranteed to be all used on football. However the impact of NIL has made schools become more agressive in trying to make the push up to the FBS level. Take the case of Sacramento State for example. <a href= "https://brobible.com/sports/article/fcs-program-sacramento-state-35-million-nil-funding/">The school had secured 35 million in name, image and likeness funding, which would by far be the highest in all of FCS for one school.</a>Now all the NIL probably wouldn't go directly into football alone, but it is nonetheless signifigant.Barry Broome of the Greater Sacramento Economic Council is a huge advocate of Sac State's potential move to the Pac-12, saying "We’re the biggest market on the table for the Pac-12. $35 million NIL raised in what was 36 hours starting Sunday morning, brand new stadium and you’re the state capitol of California, to me it’s a no brainer.”</p>

				<p>FCS coaches aren't paid to the exorbidant amounts as FBS coaches are. While the top earners at the FBS level are earning over 10 million, some of the higher paid FCS coaches are at max being paid 500,000 in base salary. </p>

				


					<iframe title="FCS Football Head Coach Salaries as of 2023" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-weS3R" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/weS3R/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="663" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>


			<p>As you can see from this data,the highest paid coaches aren't always equated to consistent success. Mike London, the only coach here paid a base salary above 500,000, has only made one FCS playoff appearence in 5 seasons. The most successfull head coach here is Montana's Bobby Hauck. In 13 seasons in two different head coaching stints, he's taken the team to the playoffs 11 times. Though its a little unfair to judge schools like Cal Poly and Tennessee State, who just recently hired these new head coaches and don't have a large sample size.</p>

			<p>Through this data, we can analyze that the best schools in the FCS really do care about their football programs enough to spend a large revenue on the sport. But even if you spend large amounts of money, that dosen't always equal success. There's a better chance to succeed for sure, but it could end up costing a team long term if results on the field don't show up.<p>
